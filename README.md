# boston-clojure-group-talk

Code from my (virtual) talk for the Boston Clojure Group, 12 Feb 02015

Please see the code and commentary in 'boston-transcript.scm'.

Also, please note that the tests in 'variadic-lambda-tests.scm'
accreted over time, while I was experimenting with different versions
of the relational interpreter.  As a result, many of the tests won't
run correctly without modifying the interpreter.  This test file is
intended mostly for inspiration, and as an example of the sorts of
queries can be run against the relational interpreter.  Please
experiment on your own!  You may want to comment out or reorder
various language forms in the relational interpreter in order to speed
up or bias the search.

'boston-transcript.scm' contains a few queries which work
well with this version of the relational interpeter.
